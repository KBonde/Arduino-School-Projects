Thermostat demo project
--------------------------------

Simple project that demonstrates the usage of Vernier Thermostat.
The program calculates the temperature based on the raw data from
a Vernier thermostate plugged in to the second analog plug on the
Vernier shield. The program also calculates and displays average
temperatures and turns on the LED if the current temp is above
30 degrees.
